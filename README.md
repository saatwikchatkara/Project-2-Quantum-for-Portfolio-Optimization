## Introduction

In the complex landscape of financial markets, **portfolio optimization** stands as a cornerstone for investors aiming to balance risk and return. Traditional methods often rely on historical data to estimate crucial parameters like expected returns and, more critically, the covariance matrix. However, historical covariance matrices are notoriously noisy, unstable, and prone to estimation errors, especially when dealing with a large number of assets or limited data. This inherent noisiness can lead to suboptimal or even fragile portfolios that underperform in real-world scenarios.

This project introduces a **hybrid quantum-classical approach** designed to tackle these challenges head-on. Our methodology integrates two powerful concepts:
1.  **Classical Factor Models for Enhanced Covariance Estimation:** By distilling the underlying drivers of asset returns into a few principal factors, we construct a more stable and robust covariance matrix. This significantly reduces the noise inherent in purely historical estimates, leading to more reliable risk assessments.
2.  **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for Portfolio Selection:** We frame the portfolio selection problem, specifically with a **cardinality constraint** (i.e., selecting a predetermined number of assets), as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. QAOA, a promising algorithm for near-term quantum computers (NISQ devices), is then employed to find approximate solutions to this challenging optimization problem.

The overarching goal of this project is to showcase the potential of quantum computing to enhance financial decision-making by demonstrating a complete pipeline: from sophisticated classical data pre-processing to the application of a quantum algorithm and subsequent hyperparameter optimization.

## Features

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for quantum-enhanced portfolio optimization:

* **Automated Financial Data Ingestion:** Seamlessly downloads historical adjusted close prices for specified Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) or stocks using the `yfinance` library, providing a flexible data foundation.
* **Robust Factor Model Implementation:** Leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify latent risk factors in asset returns. This allows for the construction of a more stable and less noisy covariance matrix, crucial for reliable portfolio optimization.
* **Classical Portfolio Optimization Benchmark:** Includes a classical minimum variance portfolio optimization using `scipy.optimize`, serving as a baseline to evaluate the performance of the quantum-derived solutions.
* **QUBO Problem Formulation:** Accurately translates the combined objectives of risk minimization, return maximization, and cardinality constraint enforcement into a QUBO matrix, making the problem amenable to quantum solvers.
* **PennyLane-Powered QAOA Core:** Implements the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm using PennyLane, a leading framework for quantum machine learning. This includes the construction of the QAOA cost and mixer Hamiltonians, and the variational quantum circuit.
* **Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning Framework:** Employs a robust grid search to explore the critical hyperparameters of the QAOA and its associated objective function. This includes the risk aversion coefficient (`q`), the cardinality penalty (`lambda`), the number of QAOA layers (`p`), and the classical optimizer's step size.
* **Detailed Performance Analysis & Visualization:** Generates informative outputs including optimal portfolio weights, key financial performance metrics (annualized return, risk, Sharpe ratio), and insightful visualizations like portfolio allocation bar charts and quantum state bitstring distributions.
* **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture:** Demonstrates a practical hybrid workflow where classical computation handles data preprocessing and hyperparameter search, while the quantum computer (simulated in this case) tackles the core combinatorial optimization problem.

## Methodology

### Factor Model for Covariance Estimation: Enhancing Robustness

The foundation of any robust portfolio optimization lies in an accurate and stable estimate of the asset covariance matrix ($\Sigma$). Traditional empirical covariance matrices, directly calculated from historical returns, suffer from significant noise, especially when the number of assets approaches or exceeds the number of historical observations. This can lead to volatile optimization results and portfolios that are not truly diversified.

To overcome this, we adopt a **single-factor model** based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The core idea is that asset returns are driven by a small number of common (systematic) factors plus idiosyncratic (asset-specific) risk. The covariance matrix is then reconstructed using this factor structure:

$$
\Sigma = B \Sigma_F B^T + D
$$

Where:
* $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is the $N \times N$ reconstructed covariance matrix for $N$ assets.
* $\mathbf{B}$ (Factor Loadings) is an $N \times K$ matrix where $K$ is the number of principal components (factors) extracted. Each element $B_{ij}$ represents the sensitivity of asset $i$ to factor $j$. This matrix is derived from the eigenvectors of the historical covariance matrix.
* $\mathbf{\Sigma_F}$ (Factor Covariance Matrix) is a $K \times K$ matrix representing the covariance between the extracted factors. Since PCA ensures orthogonal factors, $\Sigma_F$ will typically be a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues representing the variance explained by each factor.
* $\mathbf{D}$ (Specific Risk) is an $N \times N$ diagonal matrix where $D_{ii}$ represents the idiosyncratic (asset-specific) variance of asset $i$ that is *not* explained by the common factors. This is calculated as the total variance of an asset minus the variance explained by the factors.

This factor model approach provides several benefits:
* **Reduced Noise:** By modeling only the systematic risk components and treating idiosyncratic risk as uncorrelated, the reconstructed covariance matrix is smoother and less prone to sampling errors.
* **Improved Stability:** The estimates become more stable over time, leading to more consistent portfolio decisions.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Instead of estimating $N(N+1)/2$ unique elements in a full covariance matrix, we estimate $N \times K$ factor loadings, $K$ factor variances, and $N$ specific variances, which is significantly fewer if $K \ll N$.

### Portfolio Optimization as a QUBO Problem: Bridging Classical and Quantum

To leverage quantum computing, the portfolio selection problem must be mapped into a form that quantum algorithms can process. The **Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)** format is a natural fit for many combinatorial optimization problems and is directly compatible with QAOA.

Our objective function for portfolio selection, which we aim to minimize, balances risk, return, and a cardinality constraint:

$$
C(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}^T \Sigma \mathbf{x} - q \cdot \boldsymbol{\mu}^T \mathbf{x} + \lambda (\sum_{i=1}^N x_i - K)^2
$$

Here:
* $\mathbf{x} = [x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{N-1}]^T$ is a binary vector where $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$. If $x_i = 1$, asset $i$ is selected for the portfolio; if $x_i = 0$, it is not.
* $\Sigma$ is the $N \times N$ (factor model) covariance matrix.
* $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the $N \times 1$ vector of expected returns.
* $q$ (`q_risk_aversion`) is a tunable hyperparameter representing the risk aversion coefficient. A higher $q$ places more emphasis on maximizing expected returns, potentially at the cost of higher risk.
* $\lambda$ (`lambda_penalty`) is a tunable hyperparameter representing the penalty strength for violating the cardinality constraint.
* $K$ (`K_target_assets`) is the target number of assets to be selected in the portfolio. The term $(\sum_{i=1}^N x_i - K)^2$ penalizes portfolios that do not have exactly $K$ assets.

To convert this expression into the standard QUBO form ($\mathbf{x}^T Q \mathbf{x}$), we expand the terms:

1.  **Risk Term:** $\mathbf{x}^T \Sigma \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i,j} \Sigma_{ij} x_i x_j$
2.  **Return Term:** $-q \cdot \boldsymbol{\mu}^T \mathbf{x} = -q \sum_i \mu_i x_i$
3.  **Cardinality Penalty Term:** $\lambda (\sum_{i=1}^N x_i - K)^2 = \lambda \left( (\sum_i x_i)^2 - 2K \sum_i x_i + K^2 \right)$
    * Expanding $(\sum_i x_i)^2 = \sum_i x_i^2 + \sum_{i \ne j} x_i x_j$. Since $x_i$ are binary, $x_i^2 = x_i$.
    * So, $(\sum_i x_i)^2 = \sum_i x_i + \sum_{i \ne j} x_i x_j$.
    * The penalty term becomes: $\lambda \left( \sum_i x_i + \sum_{i \ne j} x_i x_j - 2K \sum_i x_i + K^2 \right)$
    * Rearranging: $\lambda \left( (1-2K) \sum_i x_i + \sum_{i \ne j} x_i x_j + K^2 \right)$
    * The constant $K^2$ term does not affect the optimization of $x$ and can be ignored for finding the optimal $\mathbf{x}$ vector, but it shifts the absolute value of the cost function.

Combining all terms, we construct the $Q$ matrix where diagonal elements $Q_{ii}$ correspond to coefficients of $x_i$ terms, and off-diagonal elements $Q_{ij}$ (for $i \ne j$) correspond to coefficients of $x_i x_j$ terms. In a symmetric $Q$ matrix, the coefficient of $x_i x_j$ is split as $Q_{ij} = Q_{ji} = \text{coeff}/2$.

Specifically, for our QUBO matrix $Q$:
* $Q_{ii} = \Sigma_{ii} - q \mu_i + \lambda (1 - 2K)$
* $Q_{ij} = \Sigma_{ij} + \lambda \quad \text{for } i \ne j$ (assuming symmetric $\Sigma$, the $\lambda$ coefficient is effectively $2\lambda$ for $x_i x_j$ interactions if we sum $Q_{ij}x_ix_j + Q_{ji}x_jx_i$).

Once the QUBO matrix $Q$ is formed, it is transformed into a **Cost Hamiltonian ($H_C$)** for QAOA. This involves mapping each binary variable $x_i$ to a Pauli-Z operator on a corresponding qubit using the standard mapping: $x_i \rightarrow (I - Z_i)/2$. This conversion translates the classical optimization problem into an eigenvalue problem on a quantum system.

### QAOA Implementation with PennyLane: The Quantum Engine

The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm designed to find approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. It's particularly well-suited for NISQ-era quantum computers due to its relatively shallow circuit depth and hybrid quantum-classical nature.

Our implementation uses **PennyLane**, a powerful open-source library that integrates quantum hardware and simulators with popular machine learning frameworks.

1.  **Quantum Device:** We employ `qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=num_qubits, shots=10000)`.
    * `lightning.qubit` is a highly efficient state-vector simulator backend developed by PennyLane.
    * `wires=num_qubits` specifies the number of qubits, corresponding to the number of assets.
    * Crucially, `shots=10000` enables **shot-based simulation**. While `lightning.qubit` can perform analytical expectation value calculations for optimization (which are typically faster and exact), specifying shots allows it to perform actual measurement sampling, which is necessary for the `qml.sample` function used to obtain bitstring distributions from the final quantum state.

2.  **QAOA Circuit (`qaoa_circuit`):** This is the core quantum routine responsible for finding the optimal angles.
    * **Initialization:** All qubits are initialized into an equal superposition state using Hadamard gates (`qml.Hadamard`). This ensures that all possible bitstrings (portfolio selections) have an initial non-zero amplitude.
    * **Alternating Operators (Layers):** The circuit consists of `p_layers` (QAOA layers), each comprising:
        * **Cost Hamiltonian Evolution:** An operator $e^{-i \gamma H_C}$ is applied, where $H_C$ is the Cost Hamiltonian derived from the QUBO problem, and $\gamma$ is a variational angle. This operator encodes the problem's cost function into the quantum state, driving the amplitudes of low-cost solutions higher. Our implementation manually applies the exponential of each term in $H_C$ (Pauli-Z and IsingZZ terms) for precise control and efficiency.
        * **Mixer Hamiltonian Evolution:** An operator $e^{-i \beta H_M}$ is applied, where $H_M$ is the Mixer Hamiltonian, typically a sum of Pauli-X gates across all qubits ($\sum_i X_i$), and $\beta$ is another variational angle. This operator creates superpositions and allows the quantum state to explore the solution space, moving between different bitstring configurations.
    * **Output:** The `qaoa_circuit` returns the `qml.expval(h_cost)`, which is the expectation value of the Cost Hamiltonian. The objective of the classical optimizer is to minimize this value.

3.  **Classical Optimizer:** An `AdamOptimizer` is used to iteratively update the QAOA variational parameters (the $\gamma$ and $\beta$ angles for each layer). The optimizer receives the cost function (expectation value) and its gradients from PennyLane, adjusting the angles to reduce the cost.

4.  **QAOA Sampling Circuit (`qaoa_sampling_circuit`):** After the QAOA optimization converges for a given set of hyperparameters, the `best_params_for_hp_set` are fed into this circuit. Instead of returning an expectation value, this QNode returns `qml.sample(wires=range(num_qubits))`. This performs a shot-based measurement on the quantum state, yielding a distribution of bitstrings (portfolio selections) that are most likely to be optimal. The frequencies of these bitstrings provide insights into the algorithm's preference for certain asset combinations.

### Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the Optimizer

The performance of QAOA is highly sensitive to its hyperparameters, which are not learned during the quantum-classical optimization loop. Therefore, a systematic **hyperparameter tuning** process is essential to find the configuration that yields the best portfolio performance.

We implement a **grid search** strategy, exploring predefined ranges for the following critical hyperparameters:

* **`q_risk_aversion_values`**: Controls the balance between risk minimization and return maximization in the financial objective. This parameter directly influences the diagonal elements of the QUBO matrix $Q$. Experimenting with different values helps find the optimal risk-return trade-off for the desired portfolio.
* **`lambda_penalty_values`**: Determines the strength of the penalty for violating the cardinality constraint (selecting exactly `K_target_assets`). A very low $\lambda$ might result in portfolios with too many or too few assets, while a very high $\lambda$ might make the optimization landscape too steep, hindering convergence. This parameter significantly impacts both diagonal and off-diagonal elements of $Q$.
* **`p_layers_values`**: The number of alternating QAOA layers. A higher `p` typically allows the QAOA circuit to explore the solution space more thoroughly and approximate the true ground state better, potentially leading to more accurate solutions. However, it also increases the number of variational parameters ($2p$ total) and the depth of the quantum circuit, making optimization harder and simulation more costly.
* **`stepsize_values`**: The learning rate of the classical Adam optimizer. This controls how much the variational parameters are adjusted in each optimization step. An appropriate step size is crucial for efficient convergence; too large, and the optimizer might overshoot the minimum; too small, and convergence will be slow.

For each unique combination of these hyperparameters:
1.  The corresponding `Q_matrix` and `H_cost` are constructed.
2.  Multiple independent QAOA optimization runs (`num_qaoa_runs_per_hp_set`) are performed. This is a robust practice because QAOA optimization, especially with random initial parameters, can sometimes converge to local minima. By running multiple times, we increase the chance of finding a good solution for that hyperparameter set.
3.  The best-performing set of variational angles (gamma and beta) from these runs is identified based on the lowest final cost.
4.  The `qaoa_sampling_circuit` is then executed with these optimal angles to obtain a distribution of bitstrings.
5.  Each sampled bitstring that satisfies the `K_target_assets` cardinality constraint is evaluated for its financial performance (return, risk, Sharpe ratio).
6.  The bitstring yielding the highest Sharpe ratio for that hyperparameter set is recorded as the best result.

Finally, all tuning results are collected into a pandas DataFrame, allowing for easy comparison and selection of the overall best QAOA portfolio across the entire hyperparameter search space.

## Configuration and Customization

The project is designed to be easily customizable. You can modify key parameters directly within the Python script to adapt it to your specific research or analysis needs:

* **Asset Universe:**
    ```python
    vanguard_tickers = [
        "VOO",  # Vanguard S&P 500 ETF
        "VTI",  # Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF
        "BND",  # Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF
        "VXUS", # Vanguard Total International Stock ETF
        "VGT",  # Vanguard Information Technology ETF
    ]
    ```
    Modify this list to include any other stock or ETF tickers you wish to analyze. Ensure `yfinance` supports these tickers.

* **Historical Data Range:**
    ```python
    start_date = "2018-01-01"
    end_date = "2023-12-31"
    ```
    Adjust these dates to analyze different market periods. Be mindful that very long periods might introduce stationarity issues, while very short periods might lack sufficient data for robust covariance estimation.

* **Factor Model Parameters:**
    ```python
    num_factors = 2 # For 5 assets, 2-3 factors is a reasonable starting point.
    ```
    This defines the number of principal components to extract. Experiment with this value. A good rule of thumb is to select enough factors to explain 80-90% of the variance in returns, but not so many that you reintroduce too much noise. You can inspect `pca.explained_variance_ratio_` to guide this choice.

* **Portfolio Cardinality Constraint:**
    ```python
    K_target_assets = 2 # Example: select 2 out of 5 assets
    ```
    This sets the desired number of assets in the final portfolio. The QAOA objective function will penalize solutions that deviate from this number.

* **QAOA Hyperparameter Search Space:**
    ```python
    q_risk_aversion_values = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]
    lambda_penalty_values = [5.0, 10.0]
    p_layers_values = [1, 2] # Number of QAOA layers
    stepsize_values = [0.01, 0.05] # Optimizer learning rate
    ```
    Expand or refine these lists to explore a wider or more granular range of hyperparameters. Be aware that increasing the number of values will significantly increase the total computation time.

* **QAOA Optimization Run Parameters:**
    ```python
    num_qaoa_runs_per_hp_set = 3 # Number of independent QAOA runs for each HP combination
    optimization_steps_per_run = 50 # Number of optimization steps per QAOA run
    ```
    Increasing `num_qaoa_runs_per_hp_set` can improve the robustness of finding the best parameters for a given HP set, reducing the chance of getting stuck in local minima. Increasing `optimization_steps_per_run` allows the classical optimizer more iterations to converge, potentially leading to lower costs. Both will increase runtime.

* **Quantum Device Shots:**
    ```python
    dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=num_qubits, shots=10000)
    ```
    The `shots` parameter determines how many times the quantum circuit is measured to generate the bitstring distribution (`qml.sample`). A higher number of shots leads to a more accurate statistical representation of the quantum state's probabilities but increases simulation time for sampling. For expectation value calculations (during optimization), `lightning.qubit` often uses analytical methods by default even with `shots` specified, providing exact gradients.

## Understanding the Results and Analysis

The project provides a multi-faceted analysis of the portfolio optimization:

1.  **Classical Minimum Variance Portfolio:**
    This serves as a traditional benchmark. It's a portfolio that minimizes risk without considering expected returns (or assuming a risk-free rate of zero for Sharpe ratio calculation). The weights are derived using classical convex optimization techniques.

2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning Results (`tuning_df`):**
    This DataFrame is the core output of the tuning process. Each row represents a unique combination of `q`, `lambda`, `p_layers`, and `stepsize`. Key columns include:
    * `final_cost`: The lowest QAOA cost achieved during optimization for that specific hyperparameter set.
    * `best_bitstring`: The asset selection (e.g., '01101') that yielded the highest Sharpe ratio among all valid bitstrings sampled for that set.
    * `best_sharpe`: The annualized Sharpe ratio for the `best_bitstring`. This is the primary metric for comparison.
    * `best_return`, `best_risk`: The annualized return and standard deviation for the `best_bitstring`.

3.  **Overall Best QAOA Portfolio:**
    After the full tuning process, the row from `tuning_df` with the highest `best_sharpe` is identified as the "Overall Best QAOA Portfolio." This represents the most financially attractive portfolio found by the QAOA given the search space.

4.  **Optimal Portfolio Weights (QAOA Result - Table & Chart):**
    The `best_weights` for the overall best QAOA portfolio are displayed in a table and visualized as a bar chart. This shows which assets were selected (non-zero weights) and how the capital is equally distributed among the selected assets (due to the binary selection model where weights are $1/K$).

5.  **Bitstring Distribution Plot:**
    This plot illustrates the probabilities of various asset combinations being measured from the final quantum state of the QAOA circuit (using the optimal parameters from the best QAOA portfolio). The height of each bar indicates the frequency of a particular bitstring being sampled. Ideally, the bitstring corresponding to the highest Sharpe ratio (or lowest cost) should appear with the highest frequency, demonstrating that the QAOA successfully learned to amplify the probability of the optimal solution.

6.  **Portfolio Performance Comparison (Classical vs. QAOA):**
    A concise table summarizes the annualized return, risk, and Sharpe ratio for both the classical minimum variance portfolio and the best QAOA-derived portfolio. This allows for a direct comparison of their financial efficacy, highlighting the potential advantages or trade-offs of the quantum approach for this specific problem instance.

## Future Enhancements and Research Directions

This project serves as a foundational demonstration. Several avenues exist for significant enhancement and further research:

* **Advanced Hyperparameter Optimization:** Replace the exhaustive grid search with more efficient methods like Bayesian Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, or Reinforcement Learning-based approaches. These methods can explore the parameter space more intelligently, potentially finding better optima faster.
* **Dynamic QAOA Ansätze:** Implement adaptive QAOA strategies where the number of layers (`p`) or the structure of the mixer Hamiltonian can change dynamically during the optimization process based on intermediate results.
* **Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE):** While QAOA is a specialized algorithm, VQE offers a more general framework for finding ground states of Hamiltonians. Exploring different VQE ansätze (e.g., Hardware-Efficient Ansätze, UCC, UCCSD) could yield improved performance or robustness.
* **Quantum Annealing:** For problems directly mappable to QUBOs, quantum annealers (e.g., D-Wave systems) are a direct alternative to gate-model QAOA. Integrating with D-Wave's Ocean SDK could provide a different quantum approach.
* **Continuous Portfolio Weights:** The current model focuses on binary asset selection. Future work could explore methods for handling continuous portfolio weights. This might involve:
    * **Amplitude Encoding:** Encoding weights into the amplitudes of quantum states, though this is complex for non-normalized weights.
    * **Basis Encoding with Multiple Qubits:** Using multiple qubits per asset to represent a range of possible weights, increasing the qubit count rapidly.
    * **Hybrid Integer/Continuous Optimization:** Developing hybrid algorithms that combine quantum optimization for selection with classical optimization for weight allocation.
* **Real Quantum Hardware Execution:** Transition from simulators to actual quantum processing units (QPUs). This would involve addressing real-world challenges like noise, limited qubit connectivity, and gate fidelities, potentially requiring error mitigation techniques.
* **Robustness and Out-of-Sample Testing:** Evaluate the long-term performance and stability of the quantum-optimized portfolios on out-of-sample data, simulating real market conditions. This is crucial for practical application.
* **Advanced Financial Constraints:** Incorporate more sophisticated and realistic financial constraints, such as:
    * **Transaction Costs:** Penalizing rebalancing or frequent trades.
    * **Minimum Investment Amounts:** Ensuring that selected assets meet certain investment thresholds.
    * **Liquidity Constraints:** Accounting for the ease of buying and selling large positions.
    * **Sector/Industry Diversification:** Adding constraints to ensure diversification across different market sectors.
* **Integration with Economic Models:** Explore more complex factor models (e.g., macroeconomic factors) or integrate with other economic theories to refine expected return forecasts and risk modeling.
